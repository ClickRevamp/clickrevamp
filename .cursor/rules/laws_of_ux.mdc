---

## 🎯 1. Hick’s Law

> The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.

**Takeaways**
- Minimize choices when speed is critical.
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps.
- Highlight recommended options.
- Use progressive onboarding.
- Don’t oversimplify to the point of confusion.

**Examples**
- Google homepage (minimal input distraction)
- Apple TV remote (simple interface)
- Slack onboarding (gradual reveal)

---

## 🎯 2. Jakob’s Law

> Users spend most of their time on other sites — so they expect your site to behave similarly.

**Takeaways**
- Meet user expectations from similar products.
- Reuse mental models to lower cognitive load.
- Ease transition with familiar UX after redesigns.

**Examples**
- Form controls mimic real-world toggles
- YouTube redesign gave option to revert

---

## 🎯 3. Law of Common Region

> Elements grouped within a clear boundary are perceived as related.

**Takeaways**
- Use borders or backgrounds to group content.
- Makes page structure easier to scan.
- Creates clarity in dense interfaces.

---

## 🎯 4. Law of Proximity

> Objects near each other are perceived as a group.

**Takeaways**
- Place related info close together.
- Space can signal functionality or hierarchy.
- Improves scannability.

**Example**
- Google Search Results

---

## 🎯 5. Law of Prägnanz

> We interpret complex images in the simplest way possible.

**Takeaways**
- The brain simplifies complex visuals.
- We prefer clear, unified shapes.
- Useful for designing icons and layouts.

---

## 🎯 6. Law of Similarity

> Visually similar elements are perceived as related.

**Takeaways**
- Match color/shape/size for functionality.
- Ensure buttons look distinct from text.
- Reuse visual patterns for clarity.

---

## 🎯 7. Law of Uniform Connectedness

> Visually connected elements are perceived as more related.

**Takeaways**
- Use connecting lines or shapes to show grouping.
- Tangible cues (arrows, backgrounds) improve scanning.
- Useful in card designs, step flows, menus.

**Example**
- Google featured snippets box

---

## 🎯 8. Mental Model

> A user’s internal model of how something works.

**Takeaways**
- Align design with user expectations.
- Familiar flows reduce friction.
- Conduct research to uncover user assumptions.

---

## 🎯 9. Miller’s Law

> People can only hold 7±2 items in working memory.

**Takeaways**
- Don’t overload with too many options.
- Use chunking to group data.
- Recognize memory varies by context.

**Example**
- Chunked layout in Bloomberg UI

---

## 🎯 10. Occam’s Razor

> The simplest solution that works is best.

**Takeaways**
- Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Trim features that don’t add value.
- Default to simplicity when in doubt.

---

## 🎯 11. Paradox of the Active User

> Users don’t read manuals. They dive in.

**Takeaways**
- Make onboarding contextual.
- Support learning as users explore.
- Use tooltips, hints, and empty state guidance.

---

## 🎯 12. Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)

> 80% of results come from 20% of inputs.

**Takeaways**
- Focus efforts where it matters most.
- Prioritize high-impact features.
- Don’t try to optimize everything equally.

---

## 🎯 13. Parkinson’s Law

> Work expands to fill the available time.

**Takeaways**
- Set realistic time constraints.
- Use autofill and defaults to reduce effort.
- Design forms and flows to encourage speed.

---

## 🎯 14. Peak-End Rule

> People judge an experience by its peak and end moments.

**Takeaways**
- Delight users at key moments.
- End on a positive note (confirmation, animation).
- Negative moments are remembered more vividly.

**Examples**
- Mailchimp "High Five"
- Uber wait experience

---

## 🎯 15. Postel’s Law

> Be liberal in what you accept, strict in what you send.

**Takeaways**
- Accept varied input styles (e.g. phone formatting).
- Tolerate user mistakes.
- Give clear feedback and define rules without being rigid.

---

## 🎯 16. Selective Attention

> People focus only on what’s relevant to their goal.

**Takeaways**
- Guide focus visually.
- Avoid ad-like designs for important content.
- Beware of “change blindness.”

---

## 🎯 17. Serial Position Effect

> First and last items are remembered best.

**Takeaways**
- Place CTAs at the start or end.
- Group minor options in the middle.
- Useful in menus, lists, onboarding steps.

---

## 🎯 18. Tesler’s Law

> Every system has an irreducible complexity.

**Takeaways**
- Shift complexity from user to system where possible.
- Don’t design only for “ideal” users.
- Build in-context help and tooltips.

---

## 🎯 19. Von Restorff Effect (Isolation Effect)

> The item that stands out is remembered best.

**Takeaways**
- Make key CTAs visually distinct.
- Avoid overusing emphasis — only highlight what matters.
- Don’t rely on color alone (a11y!).

---

## 🎯 20. Working Memory

> Temporary memory that handles tasks in the moment.

**Takeaways**
- Limit steps/screens requiring memory.
- Use visual breadcrumbs and visited link styles.
- Offload memory to UI (e.g. persistent filters).

---

## 🎯 21. Zeigarnik Effect

> Unfinished tasks are remembered better.

**Takeaways**
- Show progress bars to motivate completion.
- Prompt users to return or continue.
- Create curiosity with partial reveals.

---

✅ **Usage Tip:** Before shipping a UI component or flow, scan this file and test against 2–3 relevant laws.
