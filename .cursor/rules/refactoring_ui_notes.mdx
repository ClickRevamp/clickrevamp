# Refactoring UI â€“ Design System Notes

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Principles
- Design isnâ€™t a paint job â€” itâ€™s structure, clarity, and intentionality.
- Hierarchy is everything â€” let important things look important.
- Donâ€™t design blind â€” see your components in context (not in isolation).

## ðŸ”  Typography
- Choose a single versatile base font (utility > trend).
- Use fewer font sizes, but define them clearly: display, headline, title, body, label.
- Line height recommendations:
  - 1.2Ã— for headings
  - 1.5Ã— for body
- Limit line width to ~70â€“80 characters for optimal readability.

## ðŸŽ¨ Color Palettes
- Pick one main color, then derive tints and shades.
- Avoid muddy grays â€” warm or cool-tinted neutrals are easier on the eyes.
- Use clear semantic colors (green for success, red for danger, etc).
- Color contrast is key: support accessibility and visual hierarchy.

## ðŸ§± Layout & Spacing
- Use a modular spacing scale (4 / 8 / 16 / 32 / 64).
- Create rhythm through consistent vertical spacing.
- Use containers and cards to isolate related content.
- Balance density: give text room to breathe.

## ðŸªž Components & Patterns
- Build for reusability: same padding, corners, font scale.
- Donâ€™t over-design: start with clean structure, then layer accents.
- Prioritize consistent interaction feedback (hover, active, disabled).
- Think in terms of systems, not one-off styles.

## âœ… UI Checklist (Per Component or Screen)
- [ ] Clear hierarchy (whatâ€™s most important?)
- [ ] Consistent spacing and alignment?
- [ ] Accessible color contrast?
- [ ] Reused styles (not reinvented per screen)?
- [ ] Text is scannable and legible?

## ðŸ§  Visual Intelligence Tips
- Use shadows sparingly for elevation cues (not decoration).
- Color, size, and weight = the hierarchy trinity.
- Align to a baseline grid (usually 4px or 8px based).
