- Use **one font** across weights for simplicity and consistency
- If pairing two fonts:
  - Use contrast: sans + serif
  - Keep one neutral (e.g., Inter + Recoleta)
- Test at all sizes (especially body @ 14â€“16px and headline @ 32â€“48px)
- Donâ€™t rely on Google Fonts alone â€” but many good ones exist there
